1. Problem
From childhood to adulthood one of our company’s founders, Damon, had difficulty finding clothes in his size starting as a “husky” plus size child.  Growing into adulthood, the problems just increased, as very few clothing choices were available in general.  Often on school days when everyone was told to wear a certain color or wear branded items to support a local team it could be a nightmarish process to even locate close to the right color in your size.  Also, most of the major branded clothing does not necessarily go past size 3x, so finding a simple shirt to support the Detroit Lions could be almost impossible unless you were willing to pay exorbitant prices at the Big and Tall Men’s Store.  There you can easily find yourself paying 5x the price of Walmart at stores such DXL, KIngSize and others.  Even at the big and tall men’s store one of our founders Damon had difficulty finding 4x-6X clothes from Major Brands, characters, logos,or even sometimes basic colors or shapes because they did not keep them in stock.
Another issue experienced by one of our founders Damon found that sometimes wearing unusual shirts with unique unconventional designs could be a conversation starter.  This helps to build connections between people who otherwise would never have the pretext to speak to one another.  It can also let someone know that you are a fan of the same things or that you are a member of certain communities or interest groups: Marvel,DC, Sports Teams, Bands, etc.
Another problem that we wished to address was the issues facing new innovative designers getting their product to market.  Newer designers such as company founder Gabriel, may have difficulty finding the proper outlet to showcase their specialty designs and scaling up specific designs they develop.  There are also the issues of setting up an Ecommerce site, and dealing with issues such as hosting, SEO, etc.


2. Solution
Describe how you solved the problem and the components used.
Add some screenshots/pictures of your project.
Our company's goal is to build a business that is similar to a company like 4imprint but for mass production of specialty T-shirt, Sweatshirt, and Button Up Shirt Designs. We will be creating an E-Commerce Company that focuses on exposing its consumers to unique clothing experiences like a Facebook for clothing ideas.  From Inspirational to Cyber Punk , we will have your Style.  One of our corporate mottos is Selling your Future Favorite T-Shirt as Shirts that you will wear for years.
We will allow designers to create their own branded designs and solicit designs from major brands, media influencers, and individuals, to produce in large batches with high quality material at low cost in our factories.  We will solicit and help develop unique single design collections or specialty commemorative collectable collections from individual artists or established brands at very low cost to our customers.  We will build Brand Partnerships with traditional and social media brands for content.  We will have development teams help bring our partners ideas to market.  Giving will be an essential part of our business model as for every shirt we sell, following the Bombas model, we will provide a shirt to a person in an underserved community either a T-shirt or Professional Button Up Shirt for Job Interviews.

4. Lessons Learned
What did you learn developing this project?
Both:
Over the course of this project we have learned and deepened our understanding  of fundamental Front End Development skills such as HTML, CSS, Java Script and Bootstrap. We also learned how to use collaboration software such as Github which allowed us to simultaneously work on different parts of the project without disrupting the workflow. Another lesson learned is that good time management and clear, progressive, communication is crucial for the success of any project.
Gabriel
Using a new text editor environment (VS CODE). Learning new frameworks (bootstrap), and that i may like Front End Development more than backend!
Damon
Returning to coding and any sort of development since 2007, so the process was all seemingly new. I learned how to: use VS Code, how to write in a new language, javascript and gain an understanding of bootstrap and frameworks.  I actually enjoyed working with bootstrap, I think I understood it the most.



5. Issues/Bugs Known
Describe to the best of your knowledge all issues and bugs known.
	We have couple of know bugs such as: trouble with scaling (the elements on the page overlap when downscaling the screen), the search bar has no functionality, the automatic carousel tends switch panels at different time rates, the Dropdown Bar is currently not functioning as desired, and the “Submit Button” in the contact page increments the amount of alerts on page by 1, every time is is clicked.
6. Future Versions
One major plan for future versions/improvements to our project is the inclusion of an account feature. We plan on allowing website visitors to make an account so they can store personal information such as their credit card details, name, number, email, and address to make the check out process easier. We also want our users to be able to favorite items and be notified when things they have liked are back in stock. Another additional feature inside of accounts would be the ability to see purchase history. 
We also desire for users to be able to click on items they like and then be taken to a separate page specifically for the item they clicked on having additional information and the ability to zoom in on the article of clothing.
We desire to add a functional cart feature with the ability to save items for signed up members when they exit out of the site.
Possibly create a “Make a Design” feature where people can submit their own designs for use to make and/or create a design on the website, upload it, and then have us make it for them.
Coupons for holidays, birthdays (for members), etc…
A carousel feature that suggests “people who liked this item also liked these items” with a line of items going across the screen in a carousel like fashion.
